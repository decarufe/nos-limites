## Session Progress Log

### Session 2 - 2026-02-22

**Features Completed:**
- Feature #3: Data persists across server restart ✅ PASSING
  - Inserted test user (RESTART_TEST_12345@test.com) into SQLite database
  - Stopped server completely (killed node process)
  - Restarted server
  - Verified test user data survived restart
  - Cleaned up test data
  - No mock data patterns found in source code

- Feature #5: Backend API queries real database ✅ PASSING
  - GET /api/health executes real SQL: SELECT 1 and SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_master
  - GET /api/limits/categories uses Drizzle ORM queries on limit_categories, limit_subcategories, limits tables
  - Returns real seeded data (5 categories, 14 subcategories, 43 limits with UUIDs)
  - Server logs confirm [DB Query] prefixed SQL operations
  - Database file exists at server/data/noslimites.db (192KB)
  - No mock/static/placeholder patterns in route code

**Current Status:** 5/75 features passing (6.7%)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Backend: Express + better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM on port 3001
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript on port 5173
- Database: SQLite file at server/data/noslimites.db (WAL mode)
- Auth: JWT-based (middleware exists, not yet fully implemented)
- API routes implemented: /api/health, /api/limits/categories
- All other routes (auth, profile, relationships, notifications) are TODO

**What Should Be Worked On Next:**
- Authentication endpoints (magic link, OAuth)
- Profile CRUD
- Relationships management
- Frontend pages beyond placeholders
