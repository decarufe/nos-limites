**Current Status:** 7/75 features passing (9.3%)

**Architecture Notes:**
- Backend: Express + better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM on port 3001
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript on port 5173
- Database: SQLite file at server/data/noslimites.db (WAL mode)
- Auth: JWT-based (middleware exists, not yet fully implemented)
- API routes implemented: /api/health, /api/limits/categories
- All other routes (auth, profile, relationships, notifications) are TODO

**What Should Be Worked On Next:**
- Authentication endpoints (magic link, OAuth)
- Profile CRUD
- Relationships management
- Frontend pages beyond placeholders
